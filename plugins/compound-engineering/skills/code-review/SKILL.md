# Code Review

## Two-Stage Review

**Stage 1 — Spec compliance** (do this FIRST): verify the changes implement what was intended. Check against the PR description, issue, or task spec. Identify missing requirements, unnecessary additions, and interpretation gaps. If the implementation is wrong, stop here — reviewing code quality on the wrong feature wastes effort.

**Stage 2 — Code quality**: only after Stage 1 passes, review for correctness, maintainability, security, and performance.

## Scope Resolution

When no specific files are given, resolve scope via this fallback chain:
1. User-specified files/directories (explicit request)
2. Session-modified files (`git diff --name-only` for unstaged + staged)
3. All uncommitted files (`git diff --name-only HEAD`)
4. Untracked files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`) — new files are often most review-worthy
5. **Zero files → stop.** Ask what to review.

Exclude: lockfiles, minified/bundled output, vendored/generated code.

## Review Process

1. **Context** — read the PR description, linked issue, or task spec. Run the project's test/lint suite if available (`npm run test`, `make check`, etc.) to catch automated failures before manual review.
2. **Structural scan** — architecture, file organization, API surface changes. Flag breaking changes.
3. **Line-by-line** — correctness, edge cases, error handling, naming, readability. Use question-based feedback ("What happens if `input` is empty here?") instead of declarative statements to encourage author thinking.
4. **Security** — input validation, auth checks, secrets exposure, injection vectors (SQL, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, command, path traversal, unsafe deserialization). Flag race conditions (TOCTOU, check-then-act).
5. **Test coverage** — verify new code paths have tests. Flag untested error paths, edge cases, and behavioral changes without corresponding test updates. Flag tests coupled to implementation details (mocking internals, testing private methods) -- test behavior, not wiring.
6. **Resource cleanup** — file handles, DB connections, event listeners, timers, subscriptions. Verify cleanup on both success and error paths.
7. **Removal candidates** — identify dead code, unused imports, feature-flagged code that can be cleaned up. Distinguish safe-to-delete (no references) from defer-with-plan (needs migration).
8. **Verify** — run formatter/lint/tests on touched files. State what was skipped and why.
9. **Summary** — present findings grouped by severity with verdict: **Ready to merge / Ready with fixes / Not ready**. Do NOT auto-implement fixes. Instead, offer: **Fix all / Fix Critical+Important only / Fix specific items / No changes**.

**Large diffs (>500 lines):** Review by module/directory rather than file-by-file. Summarize each module's changes first, then drill into high-risk areas. Flag if the PR should be split.

## Severity Levels

- **Critical** — must fix before merge. Security vulnerabilities, data loss, broken functionality, race conditions.
- **Important** — should fix before merge. Performance issues, missing error handling, poor maintainability, silent failures.
- **Minor** — optional. Naming, style preferences, minor simplifications. Skip if linters already cover it.

## What to Check

Correctness:
- Edge cases (null, empty, boundary values, concurrent access)
- Error paths (are failures handled or swallowed?)
- Type safety (implicit conversions, `any` types, unchecked casts)

Maintainability:
- Functions doing too much (split by responsibility, not size)
- Deeply nested logic (extract early returns instead)
- Naming that obscures intent
- God classes / SRP violations (class with unrelated responsibilities -- split into focused classes)
- Leaky abstractions (implementation details exposed in interfaces or public APIs)

Performance:
- N+1 queries (loop with query per item — use batch/join instead)
- Unbounded collections (arrays/maps without size limits)
- Missing indexes on queried columns

Language-Specific Checks:
- **TypeScript** — hook dependency bugs (stale closures in useEffect), `any` escape hatches, unchecked nullable access
- **Python** — mutable default arguments, bare `except:`, missing `async`/`await`
- **PHP** — SQL injection via string concat, missing `strict_types`, type coercion traps
- **Security** — show attacker-controlled input path to vulnerable sink, not just "possible injection"

## Anti-Patterns in Reviews

- Nitpicking style when linters exist — defer to automated tools instead
- "While you're at it..." scope creep — open a separate issue instead
- Blocking on personal preference — approve with a Minor comment instead
- Rubber-stamping without reading — always verify at least Stage 1
- Reviewing code quality before verifying spec compliance — do Stage 1 first

## When to Stop and Ask

- Fixing the issues would require an API redesign beyond the PR's scope
- Intent behind a change is ambiguous — ask rather than assume
- Missing validation tooling (no linter, no tests) — flag the gap, don't guess

## Output Format

```
## Review: [brief title]

### Critical
- **[file:line]** — [issue]. Confidence: high|medium|low. [What happens if not fixed]. Fix: [concrete suggestion].

### Important
- **[file:line]** — [issue]. Confidence: high|medium|low. [Why it matters]. Consider: [alternative approach].

### Minor
- **[file:line]** — [observation].

### What's Working Well
- [specific positive observation with why it's good]

### Residual Risks
- [unresolved assumptions, areas not fully covered, open questions]

### Verdict
Ready to merge / Ready with fixes / Not ready — [one-sentence rationale]
```

Ground every finding in actual code -- no invented line references. Limit to 10 findings per severity. If more exist, note the count and show the highest-impact ones.

**Clean review (no findings):** If the code is solid, say so explicitly. Summarize what was checked and why no issues were found. A clean review is a valid outcome, not an indication of insufficient effort.

## Integration

- `receiving-code-review` — the inbound side (processing review feedback received from others)
- `workflows:review` — the full review command with multi-agent analysis
- `resolve-pr-parallel` — batch-resolve PR comments with parallel agents
