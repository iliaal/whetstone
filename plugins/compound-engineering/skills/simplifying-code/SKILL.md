  Simplifies, polishes, and declutters code without changing behavior. Use when
  asked to simplify, clean up, refactor, declutter, remove dead code or AI slop,
  or improve readability.

# Simplifying Code

## Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Preserve behavior** | Output must do exactly what the input did — no silent feature additions or removals. Specifically preserve: async/sync boundaries (do not convert sync to async or reverse), error propagation paths (do not alter strategy), logging/telemetry/guards/retries that encode operational intent, and domain-specific steps (do not collapse into generic helpers that hide intent) |
| **Explicit over clever** | Prefer explicit variables over nested expressions. Readable beats compact |
| **Simplicity over cleanliness** | Prefer straightforward code over pattern-heavy "clean" code. Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction |
| **Surgical changes** | Touch only what needs simplifying. Match existing style, naming conventions, and formatting of the surrounding code |
| **Surface assumptions** | Before changing a block, identify what imports it, what it imports, and what tests cover it. Edit dependents in the same pass |

## Process

1. **Read first** — understand the full file and its dependents before changing anything
2. **Identify invariants** — what must stay the same? Public API, return types, side effects, error behavior
3. **Identify targets** — find the highest-impact simplification opportunities. Impact = readability and maintainability; prioritize: control flow -> naming -> duplication -> types (see Smell -> Fix table)
4. **Apply in order** — control flow → naming → duplication → data shaping → types. Structural changes first, cosmetic last
5. **Verify** — confirm no behavior change: tests pass, types check, imports resolve

## Smell → Fix

| Smell | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Deep nesting (>2 levels) | Guard clauses with early returns |
| Long function (>30 lines) | Extract into named functions by responsibility |
| Too many parameters (>3) | Group into an options/config object |
| Duplicated block (**3+** occurrences) | Extract shared function. Two copies = leave inline; wait for the third |
| Magic numbers/strings | Named constants |
| Complex conditional | Extract to descriptively-named boolean or function |
| Dense transform chain (3+ chained methods) | Break into named intermediates for debuggability |
| Dead code / unreachable branches | Delete entirely — no commented-out code |
| Unnecessary `else` after return | Remove `else`, dedent |

## AI Slop Removal

When simplifying AI-generated code, specifically target:

- **Redundant comments** that restate the code (`// increment counter` above `counter++`) — delete them
- **Unnecessary defensive checks** for conditions that cannot occur in context — remove the guard
- **Gratuitous type casts** (`as any`, `as unknown as T`) — fix the actual type or use a proper generic
- **Over-abstraction** (factory for 2 objects, wrapper around a single call, util file with 1 function) — inline the code
- **Inconsistent style** that drifts from the file's existing conventions — match the file

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask before proceeding when:
- Simplification requires changing a public API (function signatures, return types, exports)
- Behavior parity cannot be verified (no tests exist and behavior is non-obvious)
- Code is intentionally complex for domain reasons (performance-critical, protocol compliance)
- Scope implies a redesign rather than a simplification

## Constraints

- Only simplify what was requested — do not add features, expand scope, or introduce new dependencies
- Leave unchanged code untouched — do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to lines that were not simplified
- Do not bundle unrelated cleanups into one patch — each simplification should be a coherent, reviewable unit
- Do not introduce framework-wide patterns while simplifying a small local change
- If a simplification would make the code harder to understand, skip it
- When unsure whether a block is dead code, ask instead of deleting
